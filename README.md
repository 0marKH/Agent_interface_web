# Agent Interface Web

This project provides a minimal web interface to interact with a simple conversational agent and upload files. The site runs on localhost using only Python's standard library, so no additional packages are required.

## Running

Use Python 3 to start the local server:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The server listens on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Opening this URL in a browser shows a chat box and a file upload form.

Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/` directory.
